## Web & Media
- Twitter: [@FergInTheClouds](https://twitter.com/ferg_in)
- [Ippon Podcast Site](https://podcast.ipponway.com/)
  This site was built as more of a side project by me as a way to learn how to use React.  The backend is a serverless architecture powered by AWS Amplify.  It uses S3 for media storage, CloudFront for caching and content delivery, ACM to provision the TLS certificate, and Route53 for domain name resolution.  I also helped produce and record some of the podcasts found on this site.  The current design was build by an Ippon front-end developer using React.
- [Richmond Java Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/Richmond-Java-Users-Group/)
  I hosted a talk at the Richmond JUG Meetup on June 19th, 2019 concerning the [Evolution of Java towards Functional Development in the Cloud](https://www.meetup.com/Richmond-Java-Users-Group/events/261872467/).
